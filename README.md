# Customer_segmentation_and_recommendation_system

## About dataset:

We will do our analysis based on online-retail dataset. It contains all the transactions occurring for a UK-based non-store online retail between 01/12/2009 and 09/12/2011. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gift-ware.

## Problem statement:
In this project I have made my own problem statements and have tried to solve those using different techniques.

i. Based on customer behaviour we try to achieve customer segmentation. This is an unsupervised learning technique therefore KMean is used to achieve customer segmentation.

ii. Making recommendation system based on country. This is achieved by using the apriori algorithm.

## Report and code contain five major parts. These are:

i. Cleaning and pre-processing

ii. Basic Analysis

iii. Cohort Analysis

iv. RFM analysis (Customer segmentation)

v. Recommended system using apriori
